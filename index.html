				<p>Currently going to school at U of I. I generally try to take on a lot
				ambitious projects but then realize I don't have the time for them, and put
				them on the backburner. I try to find solace in the little things
				in life.</p>
				<p>My professional interests include IoT, system programming, communications,
				signal processing, and machine learning. I enjoy creating applications,
				but I feel that the best way to make something is to understand the
				mathematics and reasoning behind it. I am helping a research group at
				the Beckman Institute as a part of the Institute for post-harvest loss
				prevention. My work there is on an android App that communicates to an
				agriculturals sensor-hub framework that is meant to be deployed in India.</p>
				<p>Personally, I have a wide array of interests. I enjoy juggling
				and learning new tricks. I play guitar, practice calligraphy, and paint
				in my downtime. Other than that, I contribute to any number of
			 	personal projects: an alarm clock with a nixie tube display, sabermetric
				machine learning models, a distributed protocol that rewards packet forwarding
				through blockchain-cryptocurrency.</p>
